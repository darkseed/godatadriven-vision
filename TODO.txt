- Depart from already existing VisualObjectMatcher class
	- in addition to existing keypoint sampling strategies, invoke 'dense sampling' strategy
	- add color: intensity + normalized rgb usually works well
		- intensity only (I)
		- color only (rg)
		- intensity+color (Irg)
	- make rotational invariance optional
		- read: disable for now
	- separate image description, catalog matching and result combining
		- every option combo results in a ranked list + distances: combine the distances of the several rankers to obtain the final result
	- invoke spatial pyramid
- Obtain data
- Investigate the usefulness of metadata: perhaps it can serve as an additional info source for result ranking
- Create a separate class for combining ranked results
- Documentation, virtual env, etc
